Works great! More requested changes:
- Add a `--no-copy` flag to skip the transferring of files, and assume they're already transferred.
- Have the ffmpeg command generate a 60fps video.
- Don't print out every single filename we end up transferring, but still do print out all the other existing output and keep the same verbosity otherwise.
