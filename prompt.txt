Generate a README.md for the project. It should have the same standard markdown format as normal github readmes, and should have a description of what the project is and what it can do, how to use it, and what the args are. Call the project "Construction Timelapse Generator"

I want to use venv for this project. Identify the pip3 dependencies it uses, and add instructions for both setting up and utilizing the virtual env. I believe this process involves another file I'll need to add to the project. Output that file separately from the README.md.

Also: In the README. md, format the arguments as a table instead of as a list. Remove the license section.

Output all of README.md inside one code block (three backticks). For the codeblocks _inside_ the readme, escape them by replacing those triple-backticks with XXX. Also, the file I'll need to add for the virtual env should also be written out in a code block.
