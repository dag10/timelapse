Great! Timelapse generation is perfect now.

Some more changes:
- When using sunrise for the start time, actually use exactly one hour _before_ that day's sunrise.
- Same thing for sunset, but one hour later.
- When a video file is successfully generated, open it using my system's `open` command.

Output the entire updated timelapse.py
