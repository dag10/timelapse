I ran this and it spend ~30sec and outputted the following, but no photos were copied over into the directory:

```
drew@drew Timelapse % python3 timelapse.py --start 12:15 --end 12:44 --days 1
Destination directory: /Users/drew/Projects/Timelapse/2023_03_27-2023_03_27
Syncing photos for 2023-03-27 between 12:15 and 12:44

```

Have it additionally output all source directories, print out the rsync command it will run, and have it run rsync verbosely.
